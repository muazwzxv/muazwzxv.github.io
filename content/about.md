# Hello, You

Welcome everyone,

For those who don't know me or if you're wondering if you should care at all (maybe you should?)

My name is Muaz Bin Wazir, I'm a Software Engineer based in Malaysia specialising in backend development, distributed systems and databases. The goal for this article is to just give an overview of my career so far.
