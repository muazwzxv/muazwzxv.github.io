## Hello, You

### About

I'm a backend software engineer at GXBank, where I work on loan origination systems and payment infrastructure. Before that, I was at Xsolla building backend services for game developers.

### What I work with

Go, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQS, Docker, Terraform. The usual suspects for distributed backend systems. I spend most of my time thinking about event-driven architectures, message reliability, and how to make things fail gracefully.

### What I write about

Production lessons from distributed systems. Things like:

- How to actually handle race conditions in distributed locks
- Making Kafka consumers resilient when they inevitably fail
- Why your async workflows break and how to make them durable
- The subtle ways message queues can betray you

I write about problems I've solved at work, usually after they've caused an incident or nearly caused one. If you're building backend systems that need to handle money, user data, or anything else that can't afford to break, this might be useful.

### Background

- Runner-up AWS Hackathon Build On Malaysia 2020
- Third runner-up AWS Hackathon Build on ASEAN 2020
- Finalist UiTM Oracle Hackathon 2021
- Bachelor of Computer Science, UiTM

If something I wrote helped you (or was completely wrong), feel free to reach out.
