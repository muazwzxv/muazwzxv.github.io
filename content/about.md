## Hello, You

### About

I'm a backend software engineer at GXBank, where I work on the bank Lending products, from our underwriting loan origination systems and the loan servicing platforms which involved payments and money movement through a core banking ledgar. Before that, I was at Xsolla working in the backend building platforms for game publishers and game developers.

### What I work with

Go, Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS, Redis, SQS, Docker, Terraform. The usual suspects for distributed backend systems. I spend most of my time thinking and working on distributed systems architectures, event driven components, message reliability, long running durable executions and how to make things fail gracefully.

Some other times, I tolerate spagetthi codes in the codebase lmao

### What I write about

Production lessons from distributed systems. Things like:

- How to actually handle race conditions with distributed locks
- Making Kafka consumers resilient with having good retries and backoff strategies
- Why your async workflows break and how to make them durable
- The subtle ways message queues can betray you

I write about problems I've solved at work and problems that I've seen other people solved at work, usually after they've caused an incident or nearly caused one. If you're building backend systems that need to handle money, user data, or anything else that can't afford to break, this might be useful.

If something I wrote helped you (or was completely wrong), feel free to reach out.
