I'm Muaz, a backend engineer working in fintech. I build systems that process loans, handle payments, and try not to lose people's money.

This blog exists because I keep running into problems that aren't well-documented, or are documented in ways that miss the important parts. The parts you only learn after something breaks in production at 2am.

I write about distributed systems, Go, Kafka, and the kind of backend infrastructure that has to work even when everything else is on fire. Most of what I share comes from actual production systems at scale, the lessons that came from debugging disasters, not from reading documentation.

Just technical deep dives when I learn something worth writing down.
If you're building similar systems and want to skip some of the painful lessons, you're in the right place.
